# Project
The purpose of this project was to explore the relationship between weather variables and latitude, as well as to use this data to plan future vacations. To do this, we used the citipy library to generate a list of over 500 cities, and the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for each of these cities. We then created scatter plots to visualize the relationship between latitude and temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. We also used linear regression to analyze these relationships further, separating the data into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

# WeatherPy
In WeatherPy, we created scatter plots to showcase the relationship between various weather variables and latitude. We found that temperature tends to increase as one approaches the equator, though there is higher variability in the Northern Hemisphere. Humidity and cloudiness did not show a strong relationship with latitude. We also used linear regression to analyze these relationships in more detail, separating the data into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

# VacationPy
In VacationPy, we first created a map to show the randomly selected cities based on their humidity and then narrowed down the weather data to cities with specific temperature, wind speed, cloudiness and Humidity.Then used the Geoapify API to find hotels located within 10,000 meters of each city's coordinates. We added the hotel name and country to the hover message for each city on the map, allowing users to easily plan a vacation to a city with their desired weather conditions. 

Overall, this project provided a useful tool for understanding the relationship between weather and latitude, and for planning future vacations.
